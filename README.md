# Get-Ready-for-Work
<h2> A text-based adventure/horror game created to practice Java.</h2>


Hello! Thanks for taking a look at this README :grin:

I created this game to work on my Java skills, along with debugging and testing. The current state of the game is playable, but it is more of a proof of function and does not currently contain the storyline. You can 'go to' any room in the house, 'look' at the rooms, and currently 'pick up' and 'use' a few items in the game.

<p><ins> Improvements to make. </ins></p>

 + Add a function that counts if you removed the eggs from the fridge.
 + Add a function that turns "use fridge" into 'look in the fridge'.
 + Why doesn't "use the coffee maker work?"
 + Why doesn't "use stove" work?

 + Add a help function that gives syntax hints
